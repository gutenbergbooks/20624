PREFACE</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">Although</span> a certain number of the
ballads in
this volume belong to England as much as to Scotland, the greater number
are so intimately connected with Scottish history and tradition, that it
would have been rash (to&nbsp;say the least) for a Southron to have
ventured across the border unaided. It is therefore more than a pleasure
to record my thanks to my friend Mr. A.&nbsp;Francis Steuart of
Edinburgh, to whom I have submitted the proofs of these ballads. His
extensive and peculiar knowledge of Scottish history and genealogy has
been of the greatest service throughout.</p>

<p>I must also thank Mr. C.&nbsp;G. Tennant for assistance with the map
given as frontispiece; and my unknown friend, Messrs. Constable’s
reader, has supplied valuable help in detail.</p>

<p>My self-imposed scheme of classification by subject-matter becomes no
easier as the end of my task approaches. The Fourth Series will consist
mainly of ballads of Robin Hood and
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
other outlaws, including a few pirates. The projected class of ‘Sea
Ballads’ has thus been split; <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>, for example,
appears in this volume. A&nbsp;few ballads defy classification, and will
have to appear, if at all, in a miscellaneous section.</p>

<p>The labour of reducing to modern spelling several ballads from the
seventeenth-century orthography of the Percy Folio is compensated,
I&nbsp;hope, by the quaint and spirited result. These lively ballads are
now presented for the first time in this popular form.</p>

<p>In <i>The Jolly Juggler</i>, given in the Appendix, I&nbsp;claim to
have discovered a new ballad, which has not yet been treated as such,
though I make bold to think Professor Child would have included it in
his collection had he known of it. I&nbsp;trust that the publicity thus
given to it will attract the attention of experts more competent than
myself to annotate and illustrate it as it deserves.</p>

BALLADS IN THE THIRD SERIES</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">I have</span> hesitated to use the term
‘historical’ in choosing a general title for the ballads in this volume,
although, if the word can be applied to any popular ballads, it would be
applied with most justification to a large number of these ballads of
Scottish and Border tradition. ‘Some ballads are historical, or at least
are founded on actual occurrences. In such cases, we have a manifest
point of departure for our chronological investigation. The ballad is
likely to have sprung up shortly after the event, and to represent the
common rumo[u]r of the time. Accuracy is not to be expected, and indeed
too great historical fidelity in detail is rather a ground of suspicion
than a certificate of the genuinely popular character of the piece....
Two cautionary observations are necessary. Since history repeats itself,
the possibility and even the probability must be entertained that every
now and then a ballad which had been in circulation for some time was
adapted to the circumstances of a recent occurrence, and has
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
come down to us only in such an adaptation. It is also far from
improbable that many ballads which appear to have no definite
localization or historical antecedents may be founded on fact, since one
of the marked tendencies of popular narrative poetry is to alter or
eliminate specific names of persons and places in the course of oral
tradition.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a></p>

<p>Warned by these wise words, we may, perhaps, select the following
ballads from the present volume as ‘historical, or at least founded on
actual occurrences.’</p>

<p>(i) This section, which we may call ‘Historical,’ includes <i>The
Hunting of the Cheviot</i>, <i>The Battle of Otterburn</i>, <i>Mary
Hamilton</i>, <i>The Laird o’ Logie</i>, <i>Captain Car</i>, <i>Flodden
Field</i>, <i>The Fire of Frendraught</i>, <i>Bessy Bell and Mary
Gray</i>, <i>Jamie Douglas</i>, <i>Earl Bothwell</i>, <i>Durham
Field</i>, <i>The Battle of Harlaw</i>, and <i>Lord Maxwell’s Last
Goodnight</i>. Probably we should add <i>The Death of Parcy Reed</i>;
possibly <i>Geordie</i> and <i>The Gipsy Laddie</i>. More doubtful still
is <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>; and
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
<i>The Baron of Brackley</i> confuses two historical events.</p>

<p>(ii) From the above section I have eliminated those which may be
separately classified as ‘Border Ballads.’ <i>Sir Hugh in the Grime’s
Downfall</i> seems to have some historical foundation, but <i>Bewick and
Grahame</i> has none. A&nbsp;sub-section of ‘Armstrong Ballads’ forms a
good quartet; <i>Johnie Armstrong</i>, <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, <i>Dick o’
the Cow</i>, and <i>John o’ the Side</i>.</p>

<p>(iii) In the purely ‘Romantic’ class we may place <i>The Braes of
Yarrow</i>, <i>The Twa Brothers</i>, <i>The Outlyer Bold</i>, <i>Clyde’s
Water</i>, <i>Katharine Jaffray</i>, <i>Lizie Lindsay</i>, <i>The Heir
of Linne</i>, and <i>The Laird of Knottington</i>.</p>

<p>(iv) There remain a lyrical ballad, <i>The Gardener</i>; a&nbsp;song,
<i>Waly, waly, gin love be bonny</i>; and the nondescript <i>Whummil
Bore</i>. The Appendix contains a ballad, <i>The Jolly Juggler</i>,
which would have come more fittingly in the First Series, had I known of
it in time.</p>

<p>In the general arrangement, however, the above classes have been
mixed, in order that the reader may browse as he pleases.</p>

Introduction (p.&nbsp;xvi) to <i>English and Scottish Popular Ballads,
edited from the Collection of Francis James Child, by Helen Child
Sargent and George Lyman Kittredge</i>, 1905. This admirable
condensation of Child’s five volumes, issued since my Second Series, is
enhanced by Professor Kittredge’s <i>Introduction</i>, the best possible
substitute for the gap left in the larger book by the death of Child
before the completion of his task.</p>


<h5 class = "section">I</h5>

<p>A comparison of the first two ballads in this volume will show the
latitude with which it is
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
possible for an historical incident to be treated by tradition. The
Battle of Otterburn was fought in 1388; but our two versions belong to
the middle of the sixteenth century. The English <i>Battle of
Otterburn</i> is the more faithful to history, and refers
(35.<sup>2</sup>) to ‘the cronykle’ as authority. <i>The Hunting of the
Cheviot</i> was in the repertory of Richard Sheale (see First Series,
<i>Introduction</i>, xxvii), who ends his version in the regular manner
traditional amongst minstrels. Also, we have the broadside <i>Chevy
Chase</i>, which well illustrates the degradation of a ballad in the
hands of the hack-writers; this may be seen in many collections of
ballads.</p>

<p><i>Mary Hamilton</i> has a very curious literary history. If,
<i>pendente lite</i>, we may assume the facts to be as suggested, pp.
44-46, it illustrates admirably Professor Kittredge’s warning, quoted
above, that ballads already in circulation may be adapted to the
circumstances of a recent occurrence. But the incidents&mdash;betrayal,
child-murder, and consequent execution&mdash;cannot have been uncommon
in courts, at least in days of old; and it is quite probable that an
early story was adapted, first to the incident of 1563, and again to the
Russian story of 1718. Perhaps we may remark in passing that it is a
pity that so repugnant a story should be attached to a ballad
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
containing such beautiful stanzas as the last four.</p>

<p><i>Captain Car</i> is an English ballad almost contemporary with the
Scottish incident which it records; and, from the fact of its including
a popular burden, we may presume it was adapted to the tune. <i>Bessy
Bell and Mary Gray</i>, which records a piece of Scottish news of no
importance whatever, has become an English nursery rhyme. In <i>Jamie
Douglas</i> an historical fact has been interwoven with a beautiful
lyric. Indeed, the chances of corruption and contamination are
infinite.</p>


<h5 class = "section">II</h5>

<p>The long pathetic ballad of <i>Bewick and Grahame</i> is a link
between the romantic ballads and the ballads of the Border, <i>Sir Hugh
in the Grime’s Downfall</i> connecting the Border ballads with the
‘historical’ ballads. The four splendid ‘Armstrong ballads’ also are
mainly ‘historical,’ though <i>Dick o’ the Cow</i> requires further
elucidation. <i>Kinmont Willie</i> is under suspicion of being the work
of Sir Walter Scott, who alone of all ballad-editors, perhaps, could
have compiled a ballad good enough to deceive posterity. We cannot doubt
the excellence of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>; but it would be tedious, as
well as unprofitable, to collect the hundred details of manner, choice
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
of words, and expression, which discredit the authenticity of the
ballad.</p>

<p><i>John o’ the Side</i> has not, I&nbsp;believe, been presented to
readers in its present shape before. It is one of the few instances in
which the English version of a ballad is better than the Scottish.</p>


<h5 class = "section">III</h5>

<p><i>The Braes o’ Yarrow</i> is a good example of the Scottish lyrical
ballad, the continued rhyme being very effective. <i>The Twa
Brothers</i> has become a game, and <i>Lizie Lindsay</i> a song. <i>The
Outlyer Bold</i> is a title I have been forced to give to a version of
the ballad best known as <i>The Bonnie Banks o’ Fordie</i>; this, it is
true, might have come more aptly in the First Series. So also
<i>Katharine Jaffray</i>, which enlarges the lesson taught in <i>The
Cruel Brother</i> (First Series, p.&nbsp;76), and adds one of its
own.</p>

<p><i>The Heir of Linne</i> is another of the naïve, delightful ballads
from the Percy Folio, and in general style may be compared with <i>The
Lord of Learne</i> in the Second Series (p.&nbsp;182).</p>


<h5 class = "section">IV</h5>

<p>Little is to be said of <i>The Gardener</i> or <i>The Whummil
Bore</i>, the former being almost a lyric, and the latter presumably a
fragment. <i>Waly,
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
waly</i>, is not a ballad at all, and is only included because it has
become confused with <i>Jamie Douglas</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Jolly Juggler</i> seems to be a discovery, and I commend it to
the notice of those better qualified to deal with it. The curious fifth
line added to each verse may be the work of some
minstrel&mdash;a&nbsp;humorous addition to, or comment upon, the
foregoing stanza. Certain Danish ballads exhibit this peculiarity, but I
cannot find any Danish counterpart to the ballad in Prior’s three
volumes.</p>

THE HUNTING OF THE CHEVIOT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> here given is that of a
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> in the Bodleian Library
(Ashmole&nbsp;48) of about the latter half of the sixteenth century. It
was printed by Hearne, and by Percy in the <i>Reliques</i>, and the
whole <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> was edited by Thomas Wright
for the Roxburghe Club in 1860. In this <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> <i>The Hunting of the Cheviot</i> is
No.&nbsp;viii., and is subscribed ‘Expliceth, quod Rychard Sheale.’
Sheale is known to have been a minstrel of Tamworth, and it would appear
that much of this <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> (including
certain poems, no doubt his own) is in his handwriting&mdash;probably
the book belonged to him. But the supposition that he was author of the
<i>Hunting of the Cheviot</i>, Child dismisses as ‘preposterous in the
extreme.’</p>

<p>The other version, far better known as <i>Chevy Chase</i>, is that of
the Percy Folio, published in the <i>Reliques</i>, and among the Pepys,
Douce, Roxburghe, and Bagford collections of ballads. For the sake of
differentiation this may be called the broadside form of the ballad, as
it forms a striking example of the impairment of a traditional ballad
when re-written for the broadside press. Doubtless it is the one known
and commented on by Addison in his famous papers (Nos. 70 and&nbsp;74)
in the <i>Spectator</i> (1711), but it is not the one referred to by Sir
Philip Sidney in his <i>Apologie</i>. Professor Child doubts if Sidney’s
ballad, ‘being so evill apparelled in the dust and cobwebbes of that
uncivill age,’ is the traditional one here printed, which is
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
scarcely the product of an uncivil age; more probably Sidney had heard
it in a rough and ancient form, ‘sung,’ as he says, ‘but by some blind
crouder, with no rougher voyce than rude stile.’ ‘The Hunttis of the
Chevet’ is mentioned as one of the ‘sangis of natural music of the
antiquite’ sung by the shepherds in <i>The Complaynt of Scotland</i>,
a&nbsp;book assigned to 1549.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;The <i>Hunting of
the Cheviot</i> is a later version of the <i>Battle of Otterburn</i>,
and a less conscientious account thereof. Attempts have been made to
identify the <i>Hunting</i> with the Battle of Piperden
(or&nbsp;Pepperden) fought in 1436 between a Percy and a Douglas. But
the present ballad is rather an unauthenticated account of an historical
event, which made a great impression on the public mind. Of that, its
unfailing popularity on both sides of the Border, its constant
appearance in broadside form, and its inclusion in every ballad-book,
give the best witness.</p>

<p>The notable deed of Witherington (stanza 54) has many parallels. All
will remember the warrior who</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘... when his legs were smitten off</p>
<p>He fought upon his stumps.’</p>
</div>

<p>Tradition tells an identical story of ‘fair maiden Lilliard’ at the
Battle of Ancrum Muir in 1545. Seneca mentions the feat. It occurs in
the Percy Folio, Sir Graysteel (in&nbsp;<i>Eger and Grine</i>) fighting
on one leg. Johnie Armstrong and Sir Andrew Barton both retire to ‘bleed
awhile’ after being transfixed through the body. Finally, in an early
saga, King Starkathr (Starkad) fights on after his head is cut off.</p>

THE BATTLE OF OTTERBURN</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given mainly from the
Cotton <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, Cleopatra C. iv.
(<i>circa</i> 1550). It was printed by Percy in the fourth edition of
the <i>Reliques</i>; in the first edition he gave it from Harleian <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 293, which text also is made use of
here. A&nbsp;separate Scottish ballad was popular at least as early as
1549, and arguments to prove that it was derived from the English ballad
are as inconclusive as those which seek to prove the opposite.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;The battle of
Otterburn was fought on Wednesday, August 19, 1388. The whole story is
given elaborately by Froissart, in his usual lively style, but is far
too long to be inserted here. It may, however, be condensed as
follows.</p>

<p>The great northern families of Neville and Percy being at variance
owing to the quarrels of Richard <span class = "smallroman">II</span>.
with his uncles, the Scots took the advantage of preparing a raid into
England. Earl Percy, hearing of this, collected the Northumbrian powers;
and, unable to withstand the force of the Scots, determined to make a
counter-raid on the east or west of the border, according as the Scots
should cross. The latter, hearing of the plan through a spy, foiled it
by dividing their army into two parts, the main body under Archibald
Douglas being directed to Carlisle. Three or four hundred picked
men-at-arms, with two thousand archers and others, under James, Earl of
Douglas, Earl of March and Dunbar, and
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
the Earl of Murray, were to aim at Newcastle, and burn and ravage the
bishopric of Durham. With the latter alone we are now concerned.</p>

<p>With his small army the Earl of Douglas passed rapidly through
Northumberland, crossed the Tyne near Brancepeth, wasted the country as
far as the gates of Durham, and returned to Newcastle as rapidly as they
had advanced. Several skirmishes took place at the barriers of the town:
and in one of these Sir Henry Percy (Hotspur) was personally opposed to
Douglas. After an obstinate struggle the Earl won the pennon of the
English leader, and boasted that he would carry it to Scotland, and set
it high on his castle of Dalkeith. ‘That,’ cried Hotspur, ‘no Douglas
shall ever do, and ere you leave Northumberland you shall have small
cause to boast.’ ‘Your pennon,’ answered Douglas, ‘shall this night be
placed before my tent; come and win it if you can.’ But the Scots were
suffered to retreat without any hostile attempts on the part of the
English, and accordingly, after destroying the tower of Ponteland, they
came on the second day to the castle of Otterburn, situated in
Redesdale, about thirty-two miles from Newcastle. The rest may be read
in the ballad.</p>

<p>‘Of all the battayles,’ says Froissart, ‘that I have made mention of
here before, in all thys hystorye, great or small, thys battayle was one
of the sorest, and best foughten, without cowards or faint hertes: for
ther was nother knyght nor squyre but that dyde hys devoyre, and fought
hand to hand.’</p>

JOHNIE ARMSTRONG</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from <i>Wit
Restor’d</i>, 1658, where it is called <i>A&nbsp;Northern Ballet</i>.
From the same collection comes the version of <i>Little Musgrave and
Lady Barnard</i> given in First Series, p.&nbsp;19. The version
popularly known as <i>Johnny Armstrong’s Last Good-Night</i>, so dear to
Goldsmith, and sung by the Vicar of Wakefield, is a broadside found in
most of the well-known collections.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the ballad has the
authority of more than one chronicle, and is attributed to the year
1530. James <span class = "smallroman">V.</span>, in spite of the
promise ‘to doe no wrong’ in his large and long letter, appears to have
been incensed at the splendour of ‘Jonnë’s’ retinue. It seems curious
that the outlaw should have been a Westmoreland man; but the
<i>Cronicles of Scotland</i> say that ‘from the Scots border to
Newcastle of England, there was not one, of whatsoever estate, but paid
to this John Armstrong a tribute, to be free of his cumber, he was so
doubtit in England.’ Jonnë’s offer in the stanza 16.<sup>3,4</sup>, may
be compared to the similar feat of Sir Andrew Barton.</p>

THE BRAES OF YARROW</h4>

by Dr. Robertson of Edinburgh, but it did not appear in the

<p>In 9.<sup>1</sup>, ‘Then’ is doubtless an interpolation, as are the

text of the fifteen or twenty variants.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;James Hogg and Sir
Walter Scott referred the ballad to two different sources, the former
legendary, and the latter historical. It has always been very popular in
Scotland, and besides the variants there are in existence several

busk ye, my bonny bonny bride.’ This was printed in vol.&nbsp;ii. of
Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>.</p>

THE TWA BROTHERS</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Sharpe’s <i>Ballad
Book</i> (1823). Scott included no version of this ballad in his
<i>Minstrelsy</i>; but Motherwell and Jamieson both had traditional
versions. Motherwell considered it essential that the deadly wound
should be accidental; but it is far more typical of a ballad-hero that
he should lose his temper and kill his brother; and, as Child points
out, it adds to the pathetic generosity of the slain brother in
providing excuses for his absence to be made to his father, mother, and
sister.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Motherwell and
Sharpe were more or less convinced that the ballad was founded on an
accident that happened in 1589 to a Somerville, who was killed by his
brother’s pistol going off.</p>

<p>This ballad is still in circulation in the form of a game amongst
American children&mdash;the last state of more than one old ballad
otherwise extinct.</p>

MARY HAMILTON</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> given here is from Sharpe’s
<i>Ballad Book</i> (1824). Professor Child collected and printed some
twenty-eight variants and fragments, of which none is entirely
satisfactory, as regards the telling of the story. The present text will
suit our purpose as well as any other, and it ends impressively with the
famous pathetic verse of the four Maries.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Lesley in his
<i>History of Scotland</i> (1830) says that when Mary Stuart was sent to
France in 1548, she had in attendance ‘sundry gentlewomen and noblemen’s
sons and daughters, almost of her own age, of the which there were four
in special of whom everyone of them bore the same name of Mary, being of
four sundry honourable houses, to wit, Fleming, Livingston, Seton, and
Beaton of Creich.’ The four Maries were still with the Queen in 1564.
Hamilton and Carmichael appear in the ballad in place of Fleming and
Livingston.</p>

<p>Scott attributed the origin of the ballad to an incident related by
Knox in his <i>History of the Reformation</i>: in 1563 or 1564 a
Frenchwoman was seduced by the Queen’s apothecary, and the babe murdered
by consent of father and mother. But the cries of a new-born babe had
been heard; search was made, and both parents were ‘damned to be hanged
upon the public street of Edinburgh.’</p>

<p>In 1824, in his preface to the <i>Ballad Book</i>, Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe produced a similar story from
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
the Russian court. In 1885 this story was retold from authentic sources
as follows. After the marriage of one of the ministers of Peter the
Great’s father with a Hamilton, the Scottish family ranked with the
Russian aristocracy. The Czar Peter required that all his Empress
Catharine’s maids-of-honour should be remarkably handsome; and Mary
Hamilton, a&nbsp;niece, it is supposed, of the above minister’s wife,
was appointed on account of her beauty. This Mary Hamilton had an amour
with one Orlof, an aide-de-camp to the Czar; a&nbsp;murdered babe was
found, the guilt traced to Mary, and she and Orlof sent to prison in
April 1718. Orlof was afterwards released; Mary Hamilton was executed on
March 14, 1719.</p>

<p>Professor Child, in printing this ballad in 1889, considered the
details of the Russian story<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2"
href = "#note2">2</a> (most of which I have omitted) to be so closely
parallel to the Scottish ballad, that he was convinced that the later
story was the origin of the ballad, and that the ballad-maker had
located it in Mary Stuart’s court on his own responsibility. In
September 1895 Mr. Andrew Lang contributed the results of his researches
concerning the ballad to <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, maintaining that
the ballad must have arisen from the 1563 story, as it is too old and
too good to have been written since 1718. Balancing this
improbability&mdash;that the details of a Russian court scandal of 1718
should exactly correspond to a previously extant Scottish
ballad&mdash;against the improbability of the eighteenth century
producing such a ballad, Child afterwards concluded the latter to be the
greater. The coincidence is undoubtedly striking; but neither the story
nor the name are uncommon.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
It is, of course, possible that the story is older than 1563&mdash;it
should not be difficult to find more than one instance&mdash;and that it
was first adapted to the 1563 incident and afterwards to the Russian
scandal, the two versions being subsequently confused. But there is no
evidence for this.</p>

KINMONT WILLIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;There is only one
text of this ballad, and that was printed by Scott in the
<i>Minstrelsy</i> from ‘tradition in the West Borders’; he adds that
‘some conjectural emendations have been absolutely necessary,’ a remark
suspicious in itself; and such modernities as the double rhymes in
26.<sup>3</sup>, 28.<sup>3</sup>, etc., do not restore confidence.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;The forcible entry
into Carlisle Castle and the rescue of William Armstrong, called Will of
Kinmouth, took place on April 13, 1596; but Kinmont Willie was notorious
as a border thief at least as early as 1584.</p>

<p>The events leading up to the beginning of the ballad were as follow:
‘The keen Lord Scroop’ was Warden of the West-Marches of England, and
‘the bauld Buccleuch’ (Sir Walter Scott of Branxholm, or ‘Branksome
Ha’,’ 8.<sup>2</sup>) was the Keeper of Liddesdale. To keep a periodical
day of truce, these two sent their respective deputies, the ‘fause
Sakelde’ (or&nbsp;Salkeld) and a certain Robert Scott. In the latter’s
company was Kinmont Willie. Business being concluded, Kinmont Willie
took his leave, and made his way along the Scottish side of the Liddel
river, which at that point is the boundary between England and Scotland.
The English deputy and his party spied him from their side of the
stream; and bearing an ancient grudge against him as a notorious
cattle-lifter
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
and thief, they pursued and captured him, and he was placed in the
castle of Carlisle.</p>

<p>This brings us to the ballad. ‘Hairibee’ (1.<sup>4</sup>) is the
place of execution at Carlisle. The ‘Liddel-rack’ in 3.<sup>4</sup> is a
ford over the Liddel river. Branxholm, the Keeper’s Hall
(8.<sup>2</sup>) and Stobs (16.<sup>4</sup>) are both within a few miles
of Hawick.</p>

<p>The remark in 16.<sup>2</sup> appears to be untrue: the party that
accompanied Buccleuch certainly contained several Armstrongs, including
four sons of Kinmont Willie, and ‘Dickie of Dryhope’ (24.<sup>3</sup>)
was also of that ilk; as well as two Elliots, though not Sir Gilbert,
and four Bells. ‘Red Rowan’ was probably a Forster.</p>

<p>The tune blown on the Warden’s trumpets (31.<sup>3,4</sup>) is said
to be a favourite song in Liddesdale. See Chambers’s <i>Book of
Days</i>, i.&nbsp;200.</p>

THE LAIRD O’ LOGIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that of Scott’s
<i>Minstrelsy,</i> which was repeated in Motherwell’s collection, with
the insertion of one stanza, obtained from tradition, between Scott’s 2
and&nbsp;3.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> as told in this variant of
the ballad is remarkably true to the historical facts.</p>

<p>The Laird was John Wemyss, younger of Logie,
a&nbsp;gentleman-in-waiting to King James <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span> of Scotland, and an adherent of the notorious
Francis Stuart, Earl of Bothwell. After the failure of the two rash
attempts of Bothwell upon the King’s person&mdash;the former at Holyrood
House in 1591 and the second at Falkland in 1592&mdash;the Earl
persuaded the Laird of Logie and the Laird of Burleigh to join him in a
third attempt, which was fixed for the 7th or 9th of August 1592; but
the King got wind of the affair, and the two Lairds were seized by the
Duke of Lennox and ‘committed to ward within Dalkeith.’</p>

<p>The heroine of the ballad was a Danish maid-of-honour to James’s
Queen; her name is variously recorded as Margaret Vinstar, Weiksterne,
Twynstoun, or Twinslace. ‘Carmichael’ was Sir John Carmichael, appointed
captain of the King’s guard in 1588.</p>

<p>The ballad stops short at the escape of the lovers by ship. But
history relates that the young couple were befriended by the Queen, who
refused to comply
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
with the King’s demand that May Margaret should be dismissed. Eventually
both were received into favour again, though the Laird of Logie was
constantly in political trouble. He died in 1599. (See a paper by
A.&nbsp;Francis Steuart in <i>The Scots Magazine</i> for October 1899,
p.&nbsp;387.)</p>

CAPTAIN CAR</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from a Cottonian <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> of the sixteenth century in the British
Museum (Vesp. A.&nbsp;xxv. fol. 178). It is carelessly written, and
words are here and there deleted and altered. I&nbsp;have allowed myself
the liberty of choosing readings from several alternatives or
possibilities.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;There seems to be
no doubt that this ballad is founded upon an historical incident of
1571. The Scottish variants are mostly called <i>Edom o’ Gordon</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> Adam Gordon, who was brother to George Gordon, Earl of
Huntly. Adam was a bold soldier; and, his clan being at variance with
the Forbeses&mdash;on religious grounds,&mdash;he encountered them twice
in the autumn of 1571, and inflicted severe defeat on them at the
battles of Tuiliangus and Crabstane. In November he approached the
castle of Towie, a&nbsp;stronghold of the Forbes clan; but the lady
occupying it obstinately refused to yield it up, and it was burnt to the
ground.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the responsibility of giving the order to
fire the castle attaches to Adam Gordon or to Captain Car or Ker, who
was Adam’s right-hand man. But when all is said on either side, it is
irrational, as Child points out, to apply modern standards of morality
or expediency to sixteenth-century warfare. It is curious that this
text, almost contemporary with the occurrence which gave rise to the
ballad, should be wholly concerned with Captain Car and make no mention
of Adam Gordon.</p>

SIR PATRICK SPENCE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from Percy’s
<i>Reliques</i> (1765), vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;71, ‘given from two <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> copies, transmitted from Scotland.’ Herd
had a very similar ballad, which substitutes a Sir Andrew Wood for the
hero. The version of this ballad printed in most collections is that of
Scott’s <i>Minstrelsy</i>, Sir Patrick Spens being the spelling
adopted.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a>
Scott compounded his ballad of two manuscript copies and a few verses
from recitation, but the result is of unnecessary length.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Much labour has
been expended upon the question whether this ballad has an historical
basis or not. From Percy’s ballad&mdash;the present text&mdash;we can
gather that Sir Patrick Spence was chosen by the king to convey
something of value to a certain destination; and later versions tell us
that the ship is bound for Norway, the object of the voyage being either
to bring home the king of Norway’s daughter, or the Scottish king’s
daughter, or to take out the Scottish king’s daughter to be queen in
Norway. The last variation can be supported by history, Margaret,
daughter of Alexander <span class = "smallroman">III.</span> of
Scotland, being married in 1281 to Erik, king of Norway. Many of the
knights and nobles who accompanied her to Norway were drowned on the
voyage home.</p>

<p>However, we need not elaborate our researches in
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
the attempt to prove that the ballad is historical. It is certainly of
English and Scottish origin, and has no parallels in the ballads of
other lands. ‘Haf owre to Aberdour,’ <i>i.e.</i> halfway between
Aberdour in Buchan and the coast of Norway, lies the island of Papa
Stronsay, on which there is a tumulus called ‘the Earl’s Knowe’ (knoll);
but the tradition, that this marks the grave of Sir Patrick Spence, is
in all probability a modern invention.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "note3" id = "note3" href = "#tag3">3.</a>
Coleridge, however, wrote of the ‘grand old ballad of Sir Patrick
Spence.’</p>

FLODDEN FIELD</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Thomas Deloney’s
<i>Pleasant History of John Winchcomb</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4"
id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> the eighth edition of which, in 1619,
is the earliest known. ‘In disgrace of the Soots,’ says Deloney, ‘and in
remembrance of the famous atchieved historie, the commons of England
made this song, which to this day is not forgotten of many.’ I suspect
it was Deloney himself rather than the commons of England who made this
song. A&nbsp;variant is found in Additional <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> 32,380 in the British
Museum&mdash;a&nbsp;statement which might be of interest if it were not
qualified by the addition ‘formerly in the possession of J.&nbsp;Payne
Collier.’ That egregious antiquary took the pains to fill the blank
leaves of a sixteenth-century manuscript with ballads either copied from
their original sources, as this from Deloney, or forged by Collier
himself; he then made a transcript in his own handwriting (Add. <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 32,381), and finally printed selections.
In the present ballad he has inserted two or three verses of his own;
otherwise the changes from Deloney’s ballad are slight.</p>

<p>A very long ballad on the same subject is in the Percy Folio, and
similar copies in Harleian <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> 293
and 367. Another is ‘Scotish Field,’ also in the Percy Folio.</p>


<p><span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Lesley says in his
History, ‘This battle was called the Field of Flodden by the Scotsmen
and Brankston [Bramstone, 8.<sup>3</sup>] by the Englishmen, because it
was stricken on the hills of Flodden beside a town called Brankston; and
was stricken the ninth day of September, 1513.’</p>

<p>The ballad follows history closely. ‘Lord Thomas Howard’
(6.<sup>1</sup>), uncle to the queen, escorted her to Scotland in 1503:
‘This is ground enough,’ says Child, ‘for the ballad’s making him her
chamberlain ten years later.’</p>

<p>‘Jack with a feather’ (12.<sup>1</sup>) is a contemptuous phrase
directed at King James’s rashness.</p>

DICK O’ THE COW</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is a combination of three,
but mainly from a text which seems to have been sent to Percy in 1775.
The other two are from Scottish tradition of the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries. I&nbsp;have made a few changes in spelling
only. The ballad was certainly known before the end of the sixteenth
century, as Thomas Nashe refers to it in 1596:&mdash;‘<i>Dick of the
Cow</i>, that mad Demilance Northren Borderer, who plaid his prizes with
the Lord <i>Iockey</i> so brauely’ (Nashe’s <i>Works</i>, ed. R.&nbsp;B.
McKerrow, iii. p.&nbsp;5). <i>Dick at the Caw</i> occurs in a list of
‘penny merriments’ printed for, and sold by, Philip Brooksby, about
1685.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is yet another of the
Border ballads of the Armstrongs and Liddesdale, and tells itself in an
admirable way.</p>

<p>The ‘Cow,’ of course, cannot refer to cattle, as the word would be
‘Kye’: possibly it means ‘broom,’ or the hut in which he lived. See
Murray’s <i>Dictionary</i>, and cp.&nbsp;9.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>‘Billie’ means ‘brother’; hence the quaint ‘billie Willie.’ It is the
same word as ‘bully,’ used of Bottom the Weaver, which also occurs in

SIR HUGH IN THE GRIME’S DOWNFALL</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> given here is comparatively
a late one, from the Roxburghe collection (iii. 456). An earlier
broadside, in the same and other collections, gives a longer but
curiously corrupted version, exhibiting such perversions as ‘Screw’ for
‘Scroop,’ and ‘Garlard’ for ‘Carlisle.’</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> in its full form relates
that Sir Hugh in the Grime (Hughie Graeme or Graham) stole a mare from
the Bishop of Carlisle, by way of retaliation for the Bishop’s seduction
of his wife. He was pursued by Lord Scroop, taken, and conveyed to
Carlisle and hanged.</p>

<p>Scott suggested that Hugh Graham may have been one of four hundred
Borderers accused to the Bishop of Carlisle of various murders and
thefts about 1548.</p>

THE DEATH OF PARCY REED</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;There are two texts
available for this ballad, of which the second one, here given, was said
to have been taken down from the singing of an old woman by James Telfer
of Liddesdale, and was so printed in Richardson’s <i>Borderers‘ Table
Book</i> (1846). It preserves almost the whole of the other version,
taken from Robert White’s papers, who recorded it in 1829; but it
obviously bears marks of having been tampered with by Telfer. However,
it contains certain stanzas which Child says may be regarded as
traditional, and it is therefore preferred here.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Percival or Parcy
Reed was warden of the district round Troughend, a&nbsp;high tract of
land in Redesdale. In the discharge of his duties he incurred the enmity
of the family of Hall of Girsonsfield (two miles east of Troughend) and
of some moss-troopers named Crosier. As the ballad shows, the treachery
of the Halls delivered Parcy Reed into the Crosiers’ hands at a hut in
Batinghope, a&nbsp;glen westward of the Whitelee stream. Local tradition
adds to the details narrated in the ballad that Parcy’s wife had been
warned by a dream of her husband’s danger, and that on the following
morning his loaf of bread happened to be turned upside
down&mdash;a&nbsp;very bad omen.</p>

<p>Further, we learn from the same source, the Crosiers’ barbarous
treatment of Parcy’s corpse aroused the
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
indignation of the neighbourhood, and they and the treacherous Halls
were driven away.</p>

<p>Girsonsfield has belonged to no one of the name of Hall as far back
as Elizabeth, whence it is argued that the ballad is not later than the
sixteenth century.</p>

BEWICK AND GRAHAME</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from several broadsides
and chap-books, but mainly depends on a stall-copy entitled <i>The Song
of Bewick and Grahame</i>, approximately dated 1740. Sir Walter Scott
considered this ballad ‘remarkable, as containing probably the very
latest allusion to the institution of brotherhood in arms’ (see
14.<sup>4</sup>, and the use of the word ‘bully’); but Child strongly
suspects there was an older and better copy than those extant, none of
which is earlier than the eighteenth century.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is concerned with two
fathers, who boast about their sons, and cause the two lads to fight.
Christy Graham is faced with the dilemma of fighting either his father
or his brother-in-arms, and decides to meet the latter; but, should he
kill his friend, he determines not to return alive. Young Bewick takes a
similar vow. They fight two hours, and at last an ‘ackward’ stroke kills
Bewick, and Christy falls on his sword. The two fathers lament, and the
ballad-singer finishes by putting the blame on them.</p>

THE FIRE OF FRENDRAUGHT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Motherwell’s
<i>Minstrelsy</i>. He received the ballad from Charles Kirkpatrick
Sharp. In Maidment’s <i>North Countrie Garland</i> there is a similar
version with a number of small verbal differences.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Frendraught in
Aberdeenshire, and Rothiemay in Banffshire, lie on opposite sides of the
Deveron, which separates the counties. A&nbsp;feud began (as&nbsp;the
result of a dispute over fishing rights) between Crichton of Frendraught
and Gordon of Rothiemay, and in a fight on the first day of the year
1630, Rothiemay and others were killed. Kinsmen of both parties were
involved; and though the broil was temporarily settled, another soon
sprang up. The Lord John of the ballad was Viscount Melgum, the second
son of the Marquis of Huntly, who was appealed to as a peacemaker
between the factions of Leslie and Crichton. Lord John and Rothiemay
were sent by the Marquis to escort Frendraught to his home,
a&nbsp;precaution rendered necessary by the knowledge that the Leslies
were in ambuscade. Arrived at Frendraught, the laird and lady entreated
the two young men to remain the night, and eventually prevailed on them
to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>However (though it was long disputed whether the fire was an accident
or not), it seems that the ancient grudge against Rothiemay moved
Frendraught to
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
sacrifice ‘a great quantity of silver, both coined and uncoined,’ in the
firing of his house for the sake of burning Rothiemay.</p>

<p>Sophia Hay (25.<sup>1</sup>) was the daughter of the Earl of Erroll,
and Viscount Melgum’s wife. The last two lines of the ballad are not
easily explained, as the lady is recorded to have been deeply attached
to her husband; but it is possible that they have been inserted from a
similar stanza in some other ballad.</p>

<p>There are two English broadside ballads, of the first and second
halves respectively of the seventeenth century, which are either the
originals of, or copies from, the Scottish ballad, which exists in many
variants. The earlier is concerned with ‘the death of a worthy gentleman
named George Stoole,’ ‘to a delicate Scottish tune,’ and the second is
called ‘The Life and Death of George of Oxford. To a pleasant tune,
called Poor Georgy.’ One of the Scottish versions has a burden
resembling that of ‘George Stoole.’</p>

THE BARON OF BRACKLEY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Alexander Laing’s
<i>Scarce Ancient Ballads</i> (1822). A&nbsp;similar version occurs in
Buchan’s <i>Gleanings</i> (1825). Professor Gummere, in printing the
first text, omits six stanzas, on the assumption that they represent
part of a second ballad imperfectly incorporated. But I think the ballad
can be read as it stands below, though doubtless ‘his ladie’s’ remark,
st. 11, is out of place.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> seems to be a combination
of at least two. An old Baron of Brackley, ‘an honest aged man,’ was
slain in 1592 by ‘caterans’ or freebooters who had been entertained
hospitably by him. In 1666 John Gordon of Brackley began a feud with
John Farquharson of Inverey by seizing some cattle or
horses&mdash;accounts differ&mdash;by way of fines due for taking fish
out of season. This eventually led to the slaying of Brackley and
certain of his adherents.</p>

<p>Professor Child suspects a commixture of the two episodes in the one
ballad, or more probably, a&nbsp;grafting of a later ballad on to an
earlier one. The character of the Baron as revealed in the ballad more
closely resembles that of the 1592 episode, while the details of the
fray are in keeping with the later story.</p>

<p>‘Peggy,’ the Baron’s wife, was Margaret Burnet, cousin to Gilbert,
Bishop of Salisbury. After Brackley’s death she married again, but not
her husband’s murderer, as the end of our ballad scandalously
suggests.</p>

<p>Brackley is near Ballater, about forty miles west of Aberdeen.</p>

THE GIPSY LADDIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Motherwell’s <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, a&nbsp;copy from tradition in
Renfrewshire in 1825. The ballad exists both in English and Scottish,
and though the English ballad is probably derived from the Scottish, it
was the first in print. It is also called <i>Johnnie Faa</i>.
Motherwell, in printing an elaborated version of the following text
(<i>Minstrelsy</i>, 1827, p.&nbsp;360), called it <i>Gypsie
Davy</i>.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The
Story.</span>&mdash;Singers&mdash;presumably gipsies&mdash;entice Lady
Cassillis down to hear them, and cast glamour on her. She follows their
chief, Gipsy Davy, but finds (stt. 5 and&nbsp;6) that the conditions are
changed. Her lord misses her, seeks her ‘thro’ nations many,’ and finds
her drinking with the gipsy chief. He asks her to return home with him.
At this point the present version becomes difficult, and the bearing of
st. 12 is not apparent. We may gather that the lady returned home with
her husband, as he proceeded to hang sixteen of the gipsies.</p>

<p>This version calls the lady ‘Jeanie Faw,’ but the majority call the
gipsy chief Johnnie Faa, which is a well-known name amongst gipsies, and
occurs as early as 1540 as the name of the ‘lord and earl of Little
Egypt.’ Gipsies being expelled from Scotland by Act of Parliament in
1609, a&nbsp;Captain Johnnë Faa and seven others were hanged in 1624 for
disobeying the ordinance, and this execution is sufficient to account
for the introduction of the name into a ballad of this kind.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
The ballad has no certain connection with the Cassillis family, and it
has been suggested that the word is simply a corruption of ‘castle,’ the
original beginning of the ballad being</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘The gipsies came to the castle-gate.’</p>

BESSY BELL AND MARY GRAY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Sharpe’s <i>Ballad
Book</i>. A&nbsp;parody of this ballad, concerning an episode of the end
of the seventeenth century, shows it to have been popular not long after
its making. In England it has become a nursery rhyme (see Halliwell’s
<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p.&nbsp;246).</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;In 1781 a Major
Barry, then owner of Lednock, recorded the following tradition. Mary
Gray was the daughter of the Laird of Lednock, near Perth, and Bessy
Bell was the daughter of the Laird of Kinvaid, a&nbsp;neighbouring
place. Both were handsome, and the two were intimate friends. Bessy Bell
being come on a visit to Mary Gray, they retired, in order to avoid an
outbreak of the plague, to a bower built by themselves in a romantic
spot called Burnbraes, on the side of Branchie-burn, three-quarters of a
mile from Lednock House. The ballad does not say <i>how</i> the ‘pest
cam,’ but tradition finds a cause for their deaths by inventing a young
man, in love with both, who visited them and brought the infection. They
died in the bower, and were buried in the Dranoch-haugh (‘Stronach
haugh,’ 3.<sup>3</sup>), near the bank of the river Almond. The grave is
still visited by pious pilgrims.</p>

<p>Major Barry mentions 1666 as the year, but the plague did not reach
Scotland in that year. Probably the year in question was 1645, when the
district was ravaged with the pestilence.</p>

SIR JAMES THE ROSE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Motherwell’s
<i>Minstrelsy</i> (1827). It is based on a stall-copy, presumably
similar to one preserved by Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford, combined
with a version from recitation, which Child none the less calls ‘well
remembered from print.’</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> has no historical
foundation, as far as can be discovered; and for once we have a
traditional tale inculcating a moral, though we do not understand why
the ‘nourice’ betrays Sir James to his enemies.</p>

<p>Michael Bruce wrote a version of the story of this ballad, which
seems to have become more popular than the ballad itself. It may be seen
in A.&nbsp;B. Grosart’s edition of his works (1865), p.&nbsp;197.</p>

CLYDE’S WATER</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the Skene <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, but I have omitted the three final
lines, which do not make a complete stanza, and, when compared with
Scott’s ‘Old Lady’s’ version, are obviously corrupt. The last verse
should signify that the mothers of Willie and Meggie went up and down
the bank saying, ‘Clyde’s water has done us wrong!’</p>

<p>The ballad is better known as <i>Willie and May Margaret</i>.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Willie refuses his
mother’s request to stay at home, as he wishes to visit his true-love.
The mother puts her malison, or curse, upon him, but he rides off. Clyde
is roaring, but Willie says, ‘Drown me as I come back, but spare me as I
go,’ which is Martial’s</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘Parcite dum propero, mergite cum redeo,’</p></div>

<p>and occurs in other English broadsides. Meggie will not admit Willie,
and he rides away. Meggie awakes, and learns that she has dismissed her
true-love in her sleep. Our ballad is deficient here, but it is obvious
from st.&nbsp;19 that both lovers are drowned. We must understand,
therefore, that Meggie follows Willie across Clyde. A&nbsp;variant of
the ballad explains that she found him ‘in the deepest pot’ in all
Clyde’s water, and drowned herself.</p>

<p>Child notes that there is a very popular Italian
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
ballad of much the same story, except that the mother’s curse is on the

the end.</p>

<p>Many copies of this ballad exist (Child prints a dozen), but this one

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;In <i>The Cruel
Brother</i> (First Series, p.&nbsp;76) it was shown that a lover must
‘speak to the brother’ of his lady. Here the lesson, it seems, is that
he must ‘tell the lass herself’ before her wedding-day. Katharine,
however, not only proves her faith to her first lover (her ‘grass-green’
dress, 10.<sup>2</sup>, shows an ill-omened marriage), but prefers the
Scot to the Southron. This lesson the ballad drives home in the last two
verses.</p>

<p>Presumably Scott founded <i>Young Lochinvar</i> on the story of this
ballad, as in six versions the Scots laird bears that name.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the Percy Folio,
but is given in modernised spelling. It lacks the beginning, probably,
and one line in st.&nbsp;3, which can be easily guessed; but as a whole
it is an infinitely fresher and better ballad than that inserted in the
<i>Minstrelsy</i> of Sir Walter Scott.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is akin to that of
<i>Kinmont Willie</i> (<a href = "#page49">p.&nbsp;49</a>). John of the
Side (on&nbsp;the river Liddel, nearly opposite Mangerton) first appears
about 1550 in a list of freebooters against whom complaints were laid
before the Bishop of Carlisle. He was, it seems, another of the
Armstrong family.</p>

<p>Hobby Noble has a ballad<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5"
href = "#note5">5</a> to himself (as&nbsp;the hero of the present ballad
deserves), in which mention is made of Peter of Whitfield. This is
doubtless the person mentioned in the first line of <i>John o’ the
Side</i> as having been killed presumably by John himself.</p>

<p>‘Culertun,’ 10.<sup>1</sup>, is Chollerton on the Tyne. Percy
suggests Challerton, and in the ballads upon which Scott founded his
version the name is ‘Choler-ford.’ ‘Howbrame wood’ and ‘Lord Clough’ are
not identified; and Flanders files, effective as they appear to be, are
not otherwise known.</p>

<h4>JAMIE DOUGLAS</h4>
<h5>AND</h5>
<h4>WALY, WALY, GIN LOVE BE BONNY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> of the ballad is here given
from Kinloch’s <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, where it is in
the handwriting of John Hill Burton when a youth. The text of the song
<i>Waly, waly</i>, I&nbsp;take from Ramsay’s <i>Tea-Table
Miscellany</i>. The song and the ballad have become inextricably
confused, and the many variants of the former contain a greater or a
smaller proportion of verses apparently taken from the latter.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the ballad as here told
is nevertheless quite simple and straightforward. It is spoken in the
first person by the daughter of the Earl of Mar. (She also says she is
sister to the Duke of York, 7.<sup>4</sup>, a&nbsp;person often
introduced into ballads.) Blacklaywood, the lady complains, has spoken
calumniously of her to her lord, and she leaves him, saying farewell to
her children, and taking her youngest son with her.</p>

<p>The ballad is historical in so far as that Lady Barbara Erskine,
daughter of the Earl of Mar, was married in 1670 to James, second
Marquis of Douglas, and was formally separated from him in 1681.
Further, tradition puts the blame of the separation on William Lawrie,
factor to the Marquis, often styled the laird of Blackwood
(‘Blacklaywood,’ 2.<sup>3</sup>), from his wife’s family estate.</p>

<p>The non-historical points in the ballad are minor
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<a name = "page165" id = "page165"> </a>
ones. The couple had only one child; and the lady’s father could not
have come to fetch her away (9.<sup>2</sup>), as the Earl of Mar died in
1668, before his daughter’s wedding.</p>

<p>I have printed the song <i>Waly, waly</i> not because it can be
considered a ballad, but simply because it is so closely interwoven with
<i>Jamie Douglas</i>. Stanza 6 is reminiscent of the beautiful English
quatrain beginning:</p>

THE HEIR OF LINNE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from the Percy
Folio, but I have modernised the spelling. For the <i>Reliques</i> Percy
made a ballad out of the Folio version combined with ‘a&nbsp;modern
ballad on a similar subject,’ a&nbsp;broadside entitled <i>The
Drunkard’s Legacy</i>, thus producing a very good result which is about
thrice the length of the Folio version.</p>

<p>The Scottish variant was noted by Motherwell and Buchan, but previous
editors&mdash;Herd, Ritson, Chambers, Aytoun&mdash;had used Percy’s
composition.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;There are several
Oriental stories which resemble the ballad as compounded by Percy from
<i>The Drunkard’s Legacy</i>. In most of these&mdash;Tartar, Turkish,
Arabic, Persian, etc.&mdash;the climax of the story lies in the fact
that the hero in attempting to hang himself by a rope fastened to the
ceiling pulls down a hidden treasure. There is, of course, no such
episode in <i>The Heir of Linne</i>, but all the stories have similar
circumstances, and the majority present the moral aspect of
unthriftiness, and of friends deserting a man who loses his wealth.</p>

<p>‘Linne,’ of course, is the place which is so often mentioned in
ballads. See note, First Series, p.&nbsp;1.</p>

that Darnley was murdered by way of revenge for his participation in the

and several minor ones, contain as much truth as may be expected in a
ballad of this kind.</p>

<p>Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle on May 2, 1568, and found refuge
in England on the 16th. The ballad was doubtless written shortly
afterwards. On March 24, 1579, a&nbsp;‘ballad concerninge the murder of
the late Kinge of Scottes’ was licensed to Thomas Gosson,

DURHAM FIELD</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is another of the lively
battle-pieces from the Percy Folio, put into modern spelling, and no
other version is known or needed. The battle of Durham, which the
minstrel says (27.<sup>1</sup>, 64.<sup>2</sup>) was fought on a morning
of May, and (64.<sup>3,4</sup>) within a month of <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling consistent for this text">Creçy</ins> and
Poictiers,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a> actually took place on October 17, 1346. Stanza 18 makes
the king say to Lord Hamilton that they are of ‘kin full nigh’; and this
provides an upper limit for the date of the ballad, as James Hamilton
was married to Princess Mary, sister of James <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>, in 1474.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;We have as
authorities for the history of the battle both Scottish and English
chronicles, but the ballad, as might be expected, follows neither very
closely. Indeed it is not easy to reconcile the Scottish account with
the English. David Bruce, the young king of Scotland, seized the
opportunity afforded by Edward <span class = "smallroman">III.</span>’s
absence in France at the siege of Calais to invade England with a large
army. They were met at Durham by an English force in three divisions,
led (according to the English chronicle) by (i) the Earl of Angus, Henry
Percy, Ralph Neville, and Henry Scrope, (ii) the Archbishop of York, and
(iii) Mowbray, Rokeby, and John of Copland. The Scots were also in three
divisions, which were led (says the Scottish version) by King
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<a name = "page182" id = "page182"> </a>
David, the Earl of Murray and William Douglas, and the Steward of
Scotland and the Earl of March respectively. The English chronicle puts
John of Douglas with the Earl of Murray, and the Earl of Buchan with
King David.</p>

<p>The ballad, therefore, that calls Angus ‘Anguish’ (11.<sup>1</sup>)
and puts him on the side of the Scots, as well as Neville
(17.<sup>1</sup>), and apparently confuses the two Douglases (14 and
21), is not more at variance with history than is to be expected, and in
the present case is but little more vague than the historical records
themselves.</p>

<p>‘Vaughan’ (13.<sup>1</sup>) may be Baughan or Buchan, though it is
doubtful whether there was an Earl of Buchan in 1346. ‘Fluwilliams’
(41.<sup>3</sup>) is perhaps a form of Llewellyn (Shakespeare spells it
Fluellen), but this does not help to identify that lord.</p>

THE BATTLE OF HARLAW</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> of this ballad was sent to
Professor Child by Mr. C.&nbsp;E. Dalrymple of Kinaldie, Aberdeenshire,
from whose version the printed variants (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, Third
Series, vii. 393, and Aytoun’s <i>Ballads of Scotland</i>, i.&nbsp;75)
have been more or less directly derived.</p>

<p>The ballad is one of those mentioned in <i>The Complaynt of
Scotland</i> (1549), like the ‘Hunttis of Chevet’ (see <a href =
"#page2">p.&nbsp;2</a> of this volume). It is again mentioned as being
in print in 1668; but the latter may possibly refer to a poem on the
battle, afterwards printed in Allan Ramsay’s <i>Evergreen</i>. The fact
that the present ballad omits all reference to the Earl of Mar, and
deals with the Forbes brothers, who are not otherwise known to have
taken part in the battle, disposes Professor Child to believe that it is
a comparatively recent ballad.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;The battle of
Harlaw was fought on July 24, 1411. Harlaw is eighteen miles north-west
of Aberdeen, Dunidier a hill on the Aberdeen road, and Netherha’ is
close at hand. Balquhain (2.<sup>2</sup>) is a mile south of Harlaw,
while Drumminnor (15.<sup>3</sup>) is more than twenty miles
away&mdash;though the horse covered the distance there and back in ‘twa
hours an’ a quarter’ (16.<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>The ballad is narrated by ‘John Hielan’man’ to Sir James the Rose
(derived from the ballad of that name given earlier in the present
volume) and Sir
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195" id = "page195"> </a>
John the Gryme (Graeme). ‘Macdonell’ is Donald of the Isles, who, as
claimant to the Earldom of Ross, advanced on Aberdeen, and was met at
Harlaw by the Earl of Mar and Alexander Ogilvy, sheriff of Angus. It was
a stubborn fight, though it did not last from Monday to Saturday (23),
and Donald lost nine hundred men and the other party five hundred.</p>

<p>Child finds a difficulty with the use of the word ‘she’ in
4.<sup>3</sup>, despite ‘me’ in the two previous lines. Had it been
‘her,’ the difficulty would not have arisen.</p>

THE LAIRD OF KNOTTINGTON</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> was sent to Percy in 1768
by R.&nbsp;Lambe of Norham. The ballad is widely known in Scotland under
several titles, but the most usual is <i>The Broom of Cowdenknows</i>,
which was the title used by Scott in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is not consistently told
in this version, as in 11.<sup>3,4</sup> the daughter gives away her
secret to her father in an absurd fashion.</p>

<p>An English song, printed as a broadside about 1640, <i>The Lovely
Northerne Lasse</i>, is directed to be sung ‘to a pleasant Scotch tune,
called The broom of Cowden Knowes.’ It is a poor variant of our ballad,
in the usual broadside style, and cannot have been written by any one
fully acquainted with the Scottish ballad. It is in the Roxburghe,
Douce, and other collections.</p>

LORD MAXWELL’S LAST GOODNIGHT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the Glenriddell
<span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, and is the one on which Sir
Walter Scott based the version given in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.
Byron notes in the preface to <i>Childe Harold</i> that ‘the good-night
in the beginning of the first canto was suggested by Lord Maxwell’s
Goodnight in the Border Minstrelsy.’</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;John, ninth Lord
Maxwell, killed Sir James Johnstone in 1608; the feud between the
families was of long standing (see 3.<sup>4</sup>), beginning in 1585.
Lord Maxwell fled the country, and was sentenced to death in his
absence. On his return in 1612 he was betrayed by a kinsman, and
beheaded at Edinburgh on May 21, 1613. This was the end of the feud,
which contained cases of treachery and perfidy on both sides.</p>

<p>‘Robert of Oarchyardtoun’ was Sir Robert Maxwell of Orchardton, Lord
Maxwell’s cousin.</p>

<p>‘Drumlanrig,’ ‘Cloesburn,’ and ‘the laird of Lagg’ were respectively
named Douglas, Kirkpatrick, and Grierson.</p>

<p>The Maxwells had houses, or custody of houses at Dumfries, Lochmaben,
Langholm, and Thrieve; and Carlaverock Castle is still theirs.</p>

<p>As for Lord Maxwell’s ‘lady and only joy<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing or invisible">,’</ins> the ballad neglects
the fact that he instituted a process of divorce against her, and that
she died, while it was pending, in 1608, five years before the date of
the ‘Goodnight.’</p>

APPENDIX</h4>


<h5 class = "section">
THE JOLLY JUGGLER</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from a manuscript at
Balliol College, Oxford, No. 354, already referred to in the First
Series (p.&nbsp;80) as supplying a text of <i>The Nut-brown Maid</i>.
The manuscript, which is of the early part of the sixteenth century, has
been edited by Ewald Flügel in <i>Anglia</i>, vol. xxvi., where the
present ballad appears on pp. 278-9. I&nbsp;have only modernised the
spelling, and broken up the lines, as the ballad is written in two long
lines and a short one to each stanza.</p>

<p>No other text is known to me. The volume of <i>Anglia</i> containing
the ballad was not published till 1903, some five years after Professor
Child’s death; and I believe he would have included it in his collection
had he known of&nbsp;it.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> narrates the subjugation
of a proud lady who scorns all her wooers, by a juggler who assumes the
guise of a knight. On the morrow the lady discovers her paramour to be a
churl, and he is led away to execution, but escapes by
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
juggling himself into a meal-bag: the dust falls in the lady’s eye.</p>

<p>It would doubtless require a skilled folk-lorist to supply full
critical notes and parallels; but I subjoin such details as I have been
able to collect.</p>

<p>In <i>The Beggar Laddie</i> (Child, No. 280, v.&nbsp;116) a pretended
beggar or shepherd-boy induces a lassie to follow him, ‘because he was a
bonny laddie.’ They come to his father’s (or&nbsp;brother’s) hall; he
knocks, four-and-twenty gentlemen welcome him in, and as many gay ladies
attend the lassie, who is thenceforward a knight’s or squire’s lady.</p>

<p>In <i>The Jolly Beggar</i> (Child, No. 279, v.&nbsp;109), which, with
the similar Scottish poem <i>The Gaberlunzie Man</i>, is attributed
without authority to James <span class = "smallroman">V.</span> of
Scotland, a&nbsp;beggar takes up his quarters in a house, and will only
lie behind the hall-door, or by the fire. The lassie rises to bar the
door, and is seized by the beggar. He asks if there are dogs in the
town, as they would steal all his ‘meal-pocks.’ She throws the
meal-pocks over the wall, saying, ‘The deil go with your meal-pocks, my
maidenhead, and&nbsp;a’.’ The beggar reveals himself as a braw
gentleman.</p>

<p>A converse story is afforded by the first part of the Norse tale
translated by Dasent in <i>Popular Tales from the Norse</i>, 1888,
p.&nbsp;39, under the title of <i>Hacon Grizzlebeard</i>.
A&nbsp;princess refuses all suitors, and mocks them publicly. Hacon
Grizzlebeard, a&nbsp;prince, comes to woo her. She
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
makes the king’s fool mutilate the prince’s horses, and then makes game
of his appearance as he drives out the next day. Resolved to take his
revenge, Hacon disguises himself as a beggar, attracts the princess’s
notice by means of a golden spinning-wheel, its stand, and a golden
wool-winder, and sells them to her for the privilege of sleeping firstly
outside her door, secondly beside her bed, and finally in it. The rest
of the tale narrates Hacon’s method of breaking down the princess’s
pride.</p>

<p>Other parallels of incident and phraseology may be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>4.<sup>1</sup> ‘well good steed’; ‘well good,’ a commonplace = very
good; for ‘well good steed,’ cf. <i>John o’ the Side</i>,
34.<sup>3</sup> (<a href = "#page162">p.&nbsp;162</a> of this
volume).</p>

<p>7.<sup>1</sup> ‘Four-and-twenty knights.’ The number is a commonplace
in ballads; especially cf. <i>The Beggar Laddie</i> (as above), Child’s
text&nbsp;A, st. 13:</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘Four an’ tuenty gentelmen</p>
<p>They conved the beager ben,</p>
<p>An’ as mony gay ladës</p>
<p class = "inset">Conved the beager’s lassie.’</p>
</div>

<p>12.<sup>4</sup> For the proper mediæval horror of ‘churl’s blood,’
see <i>Glasgerion</i>, stt. 12, 19 (First Series, pp. 4,&nbsp;5).</p>

<p>13.<sup>3</sup> ‘meal-pock.’ The meal-bag was part of the
professional beggar’s outfit; see <i>Will Stewart and John</i>,
78.<sup>3</sup> (Child, No. 107, ii.&nbsp;437). For blinding with
meal-dust, see <i>Robin Hood and the Beggar</i>, ii. 77, 78 (Child, No.
134, iii. 163). The
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
